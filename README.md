## Description
​
Many times, an individual will come across an anime image or screenshot that catches their eye. If the individual is not familiar with that anime, they could end up spending hours on various websites, subreddits, comment sections and going down various other internet worm holes trying to figure out what anime that image is from.

Not anymore.

What's That Anime? is a website designed for an end user to be able to cut out those hours of mind numbing internet scrubbing and quickly find information about an unknown anime. A user can quickly drag and drop or upload a file or image URL of the anime in question and be provided with not only the name of the anime, but additional show information and related .gifs!
